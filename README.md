# [IF(ORGANIC){COMPOST}](stormy-dusk-16586.herokuapp.com)

## Inspiration
Organic waste accounts for about 31% of all waste generated by residents in New York City. This can be easily reduced by simply tossing your organic waste by separating it out and dropping it off at your nearest scrap location. However, people simply don't know about what and where to toss. Our goal is to educate people what can be separated for scraps and where to drop them off. This will promote waste reduction, and contribute to a cleaner New York City overall!

## What It Does
Simply send a picture of something you're unsure whether or not it could be scraps and get the result. Then enter your zip code for the nearest scrap location drop off, and start your journey for the zero waste pledge of New York!

## How I built it
Using a combination of Clarifai and Twilio, we were able to create an interactive educational interface all in your text messages! Special thanks to MongoDB for storing all our data and schemas.

## Challenges I ran into
